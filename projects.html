      <p class="section-intro">These are some of my proudest web and design projects, showcasing creativity, accessibility, and user-centered storytelling. Built with research, collaboration, and passion.</p>

      <!-- Project: Embracing Your Hair -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>🎓 Embracing Your Hair</h3>
        <div class="project-images">
          <img src="images/embracing-hairone.png" alt="Embracing Your Hair - page one">
          <img src="images/embracing-hairtwo.png" alt="Embracing Your Hair - page two">
        </div>
        <p>
          I developed my first website using HTML and CSS, driven by a passion for empowering others to embrace their natural hair textures. The platform was built as a safe, inclusive space for Black men and women to celebrate their hair as a form of self-expression and cultural identity. Inspired by the vitality of nature, I chose a warm, earthy palette—browns, greens, yellows, and pinks—to symbolize how natural hair, like plants, flourishes with care and community.

          This project marked my introduction to web development and product design, and I took ownership of the entire process—from ideation and visual storytelling to front-end implementation and responsive design. The result was more than just a website—it was a digital space that educates, uplifts, and connects people through shared identity and pride.

      <!-- Project: Apple Harvest Festival -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>🍎 Apple Harvest Festival - Redesigning for Accessibility</h3>
        <div class="project-images">

          <img src="images/apple-harvesttwo.png" alt="Apple Harvest Festival - page two">
        </div>
        <p>
          As part of a project for Ithaca’s renowned Apple Harvest Festival, I rebuilt the festival’s website using HTML and CSS with a focus on accessibility and responsive design. My goal was to modernize the site and make it intuitive and inclusive for users across all devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile.

          This project challenged me to think critically about layout, color contrast, and navigability, ensuring the experience was both visually engaging and accessible to a diverse audience. I refined my skills in front-end development and responsive design, emphasizing usability without compromising creativity. The final product offered a more dynamic and user-friendly digital experience, enhancing the festival’s online presence and expanding its reach.

      <!-- Project: Playful Plants -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>🌿 Playful Plants – Creating a Safer World for Kids</h3>
        <div class="project-images">
          <img src="images/playful-plantsone.png" alt="Playful Plants - page one">
          <img src="images/playful-plantstwo.png" alt="Playful Plants - page two">
        </div>
        <p>
          In collaboration with two peers in the Designing Environments for Children and Adolescents (DECA) Lab, I co-developed an interactive plant database to support safer, healthier environments for children. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we built a responsive website optimized for various screen sizes to ensure accessibility across devices.

          Grounded in inclusive design principles, the platform serves as an educational tool for caregivers, educators, and parents—helping users easily identify non-toxic plants and create nurturing spaces. This project strengthened my skills in front-end development, accessibility, and collaborative design, while allowing me to contribute to a mission-driven initiative with real-world impact.

      <!-- Project: Vintage Vynals -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>📼 Vintage Vynals – A Marketplace for Music Enthusiasts</h3>
        <div class="project-images">
          <img src="images/vintage-vynahone.png" alt="Vintage Vynals - homepage">
          <img src="images/vintage-vynahtwo.png" alt="Vintage Vynals - form page">
        </div>
        <p>
          Vintage Vynals is a dynamic, web-based platform created in collaboration with a partner to connect vintage vinyl enthusiasts in a seamless buy-and-sell marketplace. I led server-side development, building secure and scalable backend functionality using PHP, HTML, and CSS.

          The platform features account creation with secure login and registration, seller dashboards for uploading product listings and images, and a smooth shopping experience for buyers with search, browse, and checkout capabilities. I also developed an admin panel to manage users, moderate listings, and maintain site integrity.

          This project deepened my experience in full-stack development, particularly in backend logic and security, while reinforcing the importance of clean, responsive design and thoughtful user experience. The result is an engaging, functional space that brings a passionate community together through music and nostalgia.

      <!-- Project: Nexus -->
      <div class="project">
        <h3>🤞 Nexus – Building Community for Transfer Students</h3>
        <div class="project-images">
          <img src="images/Nexusone.png" alt="Nexus - homepage">
        </div>
        <p>
          Nexus is a social platform designed to help transfer students connect, build community, and navigate academic life. 
          Rooted in its name—Latin for “connection”—the platform aims to foster meaningful relationships and ease the transition 
          into a new academic environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the design efforts as part of a collaborative team project, using Figma to create wireframes and drive an intuitive, 
          accessible interface. I conducted user interviews with students and professors to understand pain points, then applied those insights
          to inform design decisions. Through iterative prototyping and user testing, I refined the platform to ensure it was both relatable and functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          By applying user-centered design principles and working closely with stakeholders, I helped shape a tool that supports inclusion and 
          belonging—creating a digital space where transfer students feel seen, supported, and empowered.
