        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Kelly — a senior at Cornell studying Information Science with a focus on UX Design and Policy.
         My design journey kicked off freshman year in Intro to Design & Program Development, where I discovered how accessibility can shape digital experiences. 
         One of my first projects—a website about natural hair—showed me how design can reflect identity, celebrate culture, and build community.

         Since then, I’ve been hooked. I’ve built websites, led digital campaigns, and crafted user-centered solutions using tools like Figma.
         I love blending creativity with strategy to create experiences that are not only beautiful, but meaningful. Whether I’m designing a product or 
         curating a brand story, I’m driven by a mission to make technology more inclusive, engaging, and empowering—especially for underrepresented communities.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Passions</h2>
        <p>I enjoy vlogging, photography, and makeup—all creative outlets that allow me to tell stories. Capturing memories is something I deeply value, 
          and I see makeup as a form of artistic self-expression. I also love singing and perform as an alto in Baraka Kwa Wimbo, an on-campus vocal group whose name means 
          “blessings through songs” in Swahili. As the group’s Social Media and Design Chair, I lead promotional efforts and create visuals that bring our music to life.

          Beyond my creative interests, I’m passionate about social justice and building inclusive spaces. I’ve worked to empower students by connecting them with resources and opportunities, and I’m committed to using design to amplify underrepresented voices. For me, the most meaningful work happens where creativity, community, and purpose intersect—and that’s the space I’m excited to keep designing in.

  <h2 class="case-title">TikTok Case Study</h2>
  <img src="images/tiktok-logo.png" alt="TikTok logo" class="case-logo" />
  <div class="case-body">
    <p>
      During my sophomore spring, I created a case study analyzing a “people problem” and ideating solutions for an
      existing application using Figma. Over ten weeks, I immersed myself in the fundamentals of product thinking,
      interaction design, and visual design. Despite the condensed timeline—shorter than the industry norm for case
      studies—I gained valuable insights into the design process and its impact.
    
      This experience taught me that great design requires empathy and a selfless approach, putting the needs of users
      first to create meaningful solutions. It also reinforced the importance of bold thinking and embracing creativity,
      as innovation often emerges from stepping outside conventional boundaries.
    
      Now, as a teaching assistant for the course, I strive to inspire aspiring product designers to adopt these principles.
      By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I aim to foster a collaborative learning environment where both
      students and I continue to grow as designers. Through this role, I am refining my skills in mentorship,
      communication, and design critique, further strengthening my expertise in user-centered design.
